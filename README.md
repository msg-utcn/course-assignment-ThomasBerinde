# Theory

Powerpoint presentations will be available under `/presentations` folder, they will be denoted by the week of the presentation `week-xyz`.

# Practical

For each week the result of the practical part will be available here as a separate branch as `week-branch-xyz`. 
We strongly encourge you to develop the solution yourself before cloning the result.

# Assignments

In order to properly review your assignments you will need to first create a repository under the organization by clicking [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/9tNzQ6qJ).
Afterwards, you will need to clone the repository and start working on it.
The workflow is as follow:
- Take the latest `master` branch code
- Checkout a new branch called `week-wyz` (the week for the assignment you are working on)
- Develop your assignment
- Create a Pull-Request and notify us via Discord/Email/Github.
- We will review it and give you the approval
- Merge it into master but take care to not delete the branch.
